## Description

This practice project is a modern UI/UX website built using React.js and CSS. It involved converting a design from a Figma file into a functional website. During this project, I learned about React file and folder structure, CSS BEM model, responsive design, CSS best practices, understanding the use of flexbox and CSS grid, and how to convert a Figma file into code.

## Features

- **React File and Folder Structure:** Organized the React components and files following a structured folder hierarchy for easier maintenance and development.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
- **CSS BEM Model:** Followed the CSS Block Element Modifier (BEM) naming convention for better organization and scalability of CSS styles.
- **Flexbox and CSS Grid:** Utilized flexbox and CSS grid for layout design and positioning of elements.
- **Conversion from Figma:** Successfully converted the design elements from a Figma file into HTML and CSS code, implementing the visual design as intended.

## Technology used

- **React.js:** Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS:** Styling language for designing the website.
- **Figma:** Used as a blueprint for coding website.
